# Accessible

Accessible is a Web Accessibility Analyzer built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Axe Core. Just enter a website URL, and the tool will evaluate its accessibility, providing a score and highlighting any issues — whether minor, moderate, or critical. It’s a handy way to make your site more user-friendly and inclusive.
